picobgp is minimalistic not-compliant-bgp free-inspired daemon for
subnetwork advertising and route topology update.

The picobgp software was written to dynamically update the routing
tables of some PCs of my vpns and so it doesn't want to became
a solution for a generic problem but I hope that this code can be useful
to someone else!

USAGE EXAMPLE
---------------

+---------+ eth0     vpn0 +---------+ eth0
| LaptopA |---------------| ServerA |----------------|
+---------+               +---------+   10.0.1.0/24
